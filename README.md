# Finding-Donors-for-Charity-ML

Machine Learning Nanodegree Project Udacity

### Project Overview
CharityML is a fictitious charity organization located in the heart of Silicon Valley that was established to provide financial support for people eager to learn machine learning. After nearly 32,000 letters sent to people in the community, CharityML determined that every donation they received came from someone that was making more than $50,000 annually. To expand their potential donor base, CharityML has decided to send letters to residents of California, but to only those most likely to donate to the charity. With nearly 15 million working Californians, CharityML has brought you on board to help build an algorithm to best identify potential donors and reduce overhead cost of sending mail. Your goal will be evaluate and optimize several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield while also reducing the total number of letters being sent.

### Dataset Information
The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository.](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income) The dataset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article “Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid”. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi online. The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the 'fnlwgt' feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries.

### Codebase
The code presented in the finding_donors.ipynb notebook file. You will additionally expect to use the added visuals.py Python file and the census.csv dataset file to perform your task. 

### How to Run the project
* Follow the Notebook finding_notebook.ipynb, each cell in the notebook is well commented which will help understand the project steps.

### What we will learn from this project
